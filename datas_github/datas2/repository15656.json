{"name": "inkscape-centerline-trace", "description": "A bitmap vectorizer that can trace along the centerline of a stroke. The builtin inkscape 'trace bitmap' can only trace edges, thus resulting in double lines for most basic use cases. It uses 'autotrace -centerline' and an optimal threshold to vectorize a pixel image.", "license": {"key": "gpl-2.0", "name": "GNU General Public License v2.0", "spdx_id": "GPL-2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/gpl-2.0"}, "starNum": 64, "folkNum": 10, "watchNum": 64, "topic": []}
